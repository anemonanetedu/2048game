# 2048game


This is a 3D version of the [2048 game] .
I use the [Three.js], WebGL library to build my game, [dat.gui] to add controller to my game and [vue-cli] to manage my project.



### How to play

+ on PC : w, a, s, d to move cubes
+ you can find the control panel on right top.
  + easy mode will prevent random falling down of new cube
  + adjust zoom when the game scene is outside your screen
  + unlock perspective will allow you to adjust camera with mouse or touch control
  + click restart to clear all cubes and restart
